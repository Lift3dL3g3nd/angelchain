# Contributing to AngelChain

Thank you for your interest in AngelChain.

This project prioritizes long-term public trust, auditability, and correctness over speed or growth.  
Contributions are welcome only when they respect these constraints.

---

## Core Principles

- Public credibility outweighs convenience
- Transparency is explicit, including limits and unknowns
- History is preserved, not rewritten
- AngelChain evolves conservatively and intentionally

---

## Repository Structure & Intent

- `main`  
  The authoritative public record.  
  All commits here are intentional, defensible statements.

- `CANON.md`  
  The Canon defines AngelChain’s purpose, boundaries, and ethical constraints.  
  No document supersedes it.

- `_private_work/`  
  Local-only drafts and experiments (intentionally not tracked).

---

## What Earns a Commit

A contribution may be committed only if all of the following are true:

- Statements are factually accurate **or** clearly labeled as assumptions or unknowns
- No speculative or promotional claims are presented as facts
- The contributor is comfortable defending the content publicly without caveats
- The content would be acceptable if it never changed again

If any of these are not true, the work should remain private.

---

## Canon Change Policy

- Canon changes require clear intent and narrow scope
- One Canon change per commit
- Canon version changes must be explicit
- Canon history is never rewritten

Minor edits clarify or constrain.
Major changes require explicit version bumps.

---

## Branching Rules

- `main` is append-only in spirit
- No rebasing or force-pushing `main`
- Draft work should occur on `draft/*` branches
- Experimental ideas may live indefinitely without merging

Mistakes are corrected forward, not erased.

---

## What AngelChain Is Not

AngelChain does not accept contributions that:

- Overpromise compliance or legitimacy
- Frame NFTs as tax receipts
- Present tokens or funding models prematurely
- Prioritize adoption over correctness

Accuracy always overrides persuasion.

---

## Final Note

AngelChain is a credibility-first project.

If a contribution improves clarity, honesty, or auditability, it is welcome.  
If it introduces ambiguity, pressure, or hype, it will be declined.

Thank you for respecting these boundaries.
